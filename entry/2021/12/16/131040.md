Co-founderのPatrick collisonさんのページが面白い。

10代へのアドバイスが載っていて，ちょっと見ただけでも面白い。  
インターネットを活用しろとか，社交性(面白くあれ)とか。

> Go deep on things. Become an expert.

> Aim to read a lot.

> Make friends over the internet with people who are great at things you're interested in. The internet is one of the biggest advantages you have over prior generations. Leverage it.

> But having good social skills confers life-long benefits. So, don't write them off. Get good at making a good first impression, being funny (if possible... this author still working on it...), speaking publicly.

> Find vivid examples of success in the domains you care about. If you want to become a great scientist, try to find ways to spend time with good (or, ideally, great) scientists in person. Watch YouTube videos of interviews. Follow some on Twitter.
